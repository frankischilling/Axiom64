# Guest tests and CI

Run the full test suite:

```sh
make test
```

The harness boots QEMU under BIOS and UEFI, checks firmware identity, requires every userspace marker, and checks the guest's explicit exit status. Fault diagnostics and failed assertions reject a run. QEMU exit code 1 represents guest success through `isa-debug-exit`.

| Test | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Static and dynamic musl ABI | Files, hard links and unlink lifetime, directories, isolation, fork/exec/wait, mappings, pipes, descriptors |
| IPC | Unix sockets, edge and one-shot epoll, batches of 256 events, select/pselect, anonymous/file/SysV shared memory |
| Signals | Masks, alternate stacks, return frames, interrupted and restarted I/O, caught faults, SIGCHLD, alarms, stop/continue |
| PTYs | Sign-extended ioctls, raw I/O, controlling-terminal lookup, foreground groups, Ctrl-C and resize signals |
| BusyBox, Bash, zsh | Real shells, substitutions, pipelines, filesystem commands, exit statuses |
| Native GNU tools | Guest compiler, assembler, linker, Make, executed C/C++ results, standard library, exceptions, rejected-source diagnostics |
| X11 | Real Xorg, drawing/GetImage comparisons, physical framebuffer pixels, twm ownership, mapped xterm with text |
| Desktop input | QEMU PS/2 mouse and keyboard; a command typed into interactive Bash creates a file checked by the guest |

The host captures `build/desktop-bios.png` and `desktop-uefi.png` after input succeeds. Logs are `build/boot-bios.log` and `boot-uefi.log`; results are in `build/boot-results.json`.

For shorter development loops:

```sh
python3 scripts/boot_test.py --suite abi --firmware bios --timeout 60
python3 scripts/boot_test.py --suite desktop --firmware bios --timeout 120
python3 scripts/boot_test.py --interactive --firmware both --timeout 180
```

These profiles omit large native development packages from a separate root filesystem. The full suite uses the full root filesystem. `--trace` logs syscall entry and results; `--gdb` exposes QEMU debugging on local TCP port 1234.

GitHub Actions builds the normal ISO and runs the full firmware suite on Ubuntu 24.04. The `axiom64-boot` artifact contains the image, kernel, logs, results, and screenshots. A separate source artifact carries upstream archives and exact package recipes. A green run applies to its tested commit; check that commit when comparing results with local changes.
